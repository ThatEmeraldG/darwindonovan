Hello there, welcome to Darwin Donovan Darmadi's Portofolio Project, this includes all my notable projects and profile summary.
This Portofolio is still WIP especially on the Projects Section, I'll include more interactivity or renew the project in the future for more simplicity. Stay Tuned!
This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
